=> What is Spring ?

Spring is an open source light weight java based framework.

By Using Spring framework we can develop several types of java applications

		-> Standalone apps
		-> Web applications
		-> Distributed Applications
		-> Microservices architecture based app


-> The applications which runs in only one computer are called as Standalone apps

		Ex: Notepad, Eclipse IDE, Calculator etc...

-> To use standalone apps we have to download and install in our computer


-> The application which can be accessed using internet is called as web application.

		Ex : facebook, gmail, irctc, ashokit.in etc...

-> Web applications we are going to access directley using browsers 


-> The applicaion which is communicating with another application is called as distributed application.

		Ex: Passport Web App  <-----> AADHAR App

		    MakeMytrip <-----> Air Lines, Hotels, IRCTC					    

-> Earlier people used to develop all the functionalities as single project (Monolith Architecture Project).

-> Now a days in the industry people are developing projects using Microservices Architecture.
